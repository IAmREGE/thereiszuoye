**<center>The population of my city</center>**  
Now the population of my city is about 2 million. Today, the population is
growing fast. We are building up Hainan Free Trade Port, so many people from
other provinces or countries come here and live here. That is one of the reasons
of this. The increase of the population will cause traffic jams, environment
pollutuon and more. But I believe the goverement, it will lead us to build a
more beautiful city and Hainan.
